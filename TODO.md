- across codebase, if next/previous page buttons are to be rendered, skip rendering them if they are both disabled.
- for /admin nextround-setup, add appropriate tags for new threads.
- when creating the vote buttons, have it use numerical buttons if any entry is over the character limit for a button
- remove gameID parameter from /superadmin add other completion
- If query is given for a search (completed games, gamedb list, etc), include the query in the output embed
- Profile view completed games (recent) should return games by date rather than addition.  Or figure out why my list is wonky, maybe bad data
