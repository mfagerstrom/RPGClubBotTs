- Normalize all embed styles / colors / etc
- Finish developing now-playing commands, the embeds could use some work
- Add parameters to /gamedb add to narrow down to certain categories
- Add note(s) to now playing entries, that would only be visible using /now-playing, not in profile
- Update help channel content, also incorporate that content into the bot's help menu
- Do a UI Pass over all embeds and try to make things look nicer, incorporate thumbnail images and/or emoji.  MP info emoji for platforms
- Linking of different versions of same game in game view (remaster, remake, port, etc)
- /now-playing create-thread, tag it, auto-source image and link to game all in one go
- /mp-info all could reuse same embed while keeping the dropdown below it, like game search does
- Add "Add to Now Playing" and "Add Completion" buttons below gamedb view embed
- Implement voting functionality, replacing Subo and canceling my subscription to it
- /superadmin todo functionality with sub commands to edit rank
- Game backlog functionality
- Game collection functionality
- Bot release notes
- User bug reports
- Now playing / Game Collection / Completion data export to .csv / excel
- Game Collection Imports - Steam, PSN, ???
- Reminder DM failures loop forever. In deliverReminder, if a DM send fails (DMs closed, rate limits), the reminder stays due and is retried every minute with no backoff or failure marking (src/services/ReminderService.ts (lines 45-76)). Add a retry cap/backoff and mark as failed or disable after repeated errors to avoid log spam and wasted work.
- Build scripts are fragile/cross-platform unfriendly: "rm -rf ./build | tsc" (and similar in buildDev/buildProd) relies on a Unix rm and uses a pipe, which can fail on Windows and doesn’t guarantee ordering (package.json:scripts). Swap to rimraf and && sequencing to make builds reliable on all environments.
