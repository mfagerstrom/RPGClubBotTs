- Create admin function for creating a new round and doing everything needed so that it's not a manual process.
- Normalize all embed styles / colors / etc
- Normalize behavior between /gamedb add, search and view
- Finish developing now-playing commands, the embeds could use some work, especially removing a now playing entry
- Move /profile nowplaying commands to /nowplaying
- Add paging to results from IGDB during game import
- Add parameters to /gamedb add to narrow down to certain categories
- Add note(s) to now playing entries, that would only be visible using /now-playing, not in profile
- Update <#927727584148611102>, also incorporate that content into the bot's help menu
- Address this: ``[ERROR] (node:23592) Warning: Supplying "ephemeral" for interaction response options is deprecated. Utilize flags instead.``
- Do a UI Pass over all embeds and try to make things look nicer, incorporate thumbnail images and/or emoji.  MP info emoji for platforms
- Linking of different versions of same game in game view (remaster, remake, port, etc)
- /now-playing create-thread, tag it, auto-source image and link to game all in one go
- /mp-info all could reuse same embed while keeping the dropdown below it, like game search does
- Add "Add to Now Playing" and "Add Completion" buttons below gamedb view embed
- Implement voting functionality, replacing Subo and canceling my subscription to it
- /superadmin todo functionality with sub commands to edit rank
- model help after /statbot's help
- Game backlog functionality
- Game collection functionality
- Bot release notes
- User bug reports
- Now playing / Game Collection / Completion data export to .csv / excel
- Game Collection Imports - Steam, PSN, ???
- RSS polling can hammer Oracle and still double-post items. processFeed opens a new connection per item via isItemSeen and does a query for every RSS entry (src/services/RssFeedService.ts (lines 40-80)). There’s also no guard against overlapping ticks, so a slow poll can overlap with the next 5‑minute interval and race the isItemSeen/markItemsSeen split, resulting in duplicate sends. Consider a single connection per poll, bulk lookups/merges, and a reentrancy flag.
- Does RSS polling even work properly?  Not seen much output from it yet
- Reminder DM failures loop forever. In deliverReminder, if a DM send fails (DMs closed, rate limits), the reminder stays due and is retried every minute with no backoff or failure marking (src/services/ReminderService.ts (lines 45-76)). Add a retry cap/backoff and mark as failed or disable after repeated errors to avoid log spam and wasted work.
- User-facing text in /remindme responses is corrupted: the help and list formatting use mojibake characters instead of bullets (src/commands/remindme.command.ts (lines 334-347)). Fix the strings to readable ASCII so users can actually parse the menu.
- Build scripts are fragile/cross-platform unfriendly: "rm -rf ./build | tsc" (and similar in buildDev/buildProd) relies on a Unix rm and uses a pipe, which can fail on Windows and doesn’t guarantee ordering (package.json:scripts). Swap to rimraf and && sequencing to make builds reliable on all environments.
- Presence updates run two overlapping timers on the same 30-minute cadence (src/RPGClubBotTS.ts (lines 31-57)): one calls updateBotPresence, the other restorePresenceIfMissing. They both hit the DB and set presence, so they’re effectively redundant work. Consider collapsing to a single loop that restores if missing and refreshes from DB in one pass.
- setPresence and setPresenceFromInteraction duplicate logic (src/functions/SetPresence.ts (lines 86-114)). You can drop one and route both call sites through a single helper that accepts a Client and optional user metadata.
- The RSS pipeline has duplicated keyword logic and extra round-trips: normalizeKeywords in RssFeedService and splitKeywords in RssFeed.ts both lowercase/trim comma lists; centralize this to avoid divergent behavior. Also, processFeed does isItemSeen per item before bulk markItemsSeen, opening a new connection each time. A single fetch of seen hashes per feed (or a connection reused within the poll) would cut redundant DB calls and race windows.
- Member activity remains a stub: recordMessageActivity/setMessageCount are no-ops while recordMessageActivity is invoked on every message (src/classes/Member.ts (lines 481-497), src/RPGClubBotTS.ts (line 143)). Either wire them to the DB or remove the call to avoid redundant, misleading code paths.
- profile.command.ts (lines 362-438) creates the nowplaying-add-select menu but handles it via awaitMessageComponent instead of a @SelectMenuComponent handler. DiscordX logs “component handler not found” for every selection (the warning in TODO). Register a handler (or mark the menu interactionCreate-handled) and clear components after selection/timeout to stop the noise and prevent re-clicks on stale menus.
