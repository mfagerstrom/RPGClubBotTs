# Task Checklist
- never edit existing .sql files.  They have already been run.  Just add new files with changes.
- name sql files starting with today's date with datestamp (ie 20251210_sql_script_name)
- Research best practices for Discord.js and DiscordX, along with Typescript, so your coding mindset isn't out of date
- You are disallowed from using npm run build or npm run buildDev
- You are disallowed from using git commands that can result in file changes or losses
- review eslint.config.ts and follow all rules outlined there
- Do not keep making this mistake: [ERROR] (node:30760) Warning: Supplying "ephemeral" for interaction response options is deprecated. Utilize flags instead.
- Do not delete the build directory.
- Table docs live in db folder
- Check the TODO.md file for development goals.  Don't do these automatically but ask me if I would like you to tackle one of them when you set up a new task context.
