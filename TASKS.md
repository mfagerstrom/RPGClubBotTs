# Task Checklist
- Every time a new session is started, update COMMIT-HISTORY.md using git history.
- never edit existing .sql files.  They have already been run.  Just add new files with changes.
- name sql files starting with today's date with datestamp (ie 20251210_sql_script_name)
- Research best practices for Discord.js and DiscordX, along with Typescript, so your coding mindset isn't out of date
- You are disallowed from using npm run build or npm run buildDev
- You are disallowed from using git commands that can result in file changes or losses
- review eslint.config.ts and follow all rules outlined there
- Do not keep making this mistake: [ERROR] (node:30760) Warning: Supplying "ephemeral" for interaction response options is deprecated. Utilize flags instead.
- Do not keep making this mistake: Discord slash commands require all required options to come before optional options; reorder parameters if you see DiscordAPIError[50035] about APPLICATION_COMMAND_OPTIONS_REQUIRED_INVALID.
- Do not keep making this mistake: when adding helper utilities (like GameDB thumbnail helpers), ensure they are imported or defined in the file before use to avoid compile-time "cannot find name" errors.
- Do not delete the build directory.
- Table docs live in db folder
- Check the TODO.md file for development goals.  Don't do these automatically but ask me if I would like you to tackle one of them when you set up a new task context.
- At the start of each session, scan the entire project and ensure that all /help content is up to date.
- Never edit files in the build folder.  They're irrelevant.
- Do not keep making this mistake: avoid leaving unused imports/variables after refactors; clean them up before finishing.
- Do not keep making this mistake: stop reminding the user about local WSL/compile limitations—assume they'll run npm commands themselves unless they ask.
- Aim for clean, centralized patterns (e.g., shared helpers/defaults) instead of duplicating magic numbers or flags across files.
- Do not keep making this mistake: use Discord flags for ephemerality instead of the deprecated `ephemeral` option when sending interaction responses.
